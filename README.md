## **HI THERE! I'M @oynozan**

I'm currently studying as an Industrial Engineering student at Yıldız Teknik University and working as a Fullstack Web Developer.

To talk about my past experiences and career development, I can call myself a Full-stack Web Developer with more than 4 years of experience. I've done dozens of personal projects such as websites, PHP/Python scripts, automation apps, desktop applications, and coding challenges.

To detail my past job experiences, I can say that I've generally taken freelance jobs related to Frontend development and automation bot coding. Currently working on multiple startups as a Full-stack Web Developer and generally using MERN stack to develop web apps.

I have a solid experience in backend development with PHP and Node.js. I've worked with Database Management Systems such as Firebase Realtime Database, phpMyAdmin (MySQL), and MongoDB (NoSQL). Beyond that, I'm getting used to new technologies like Web3.js. One of the startups I'm currently working at is engaged in blockchain technologies.

Besides the multiple jobs I'm working on, I also develop personal projects right now. One of them is related to artificial intelligence since it's quite popular nowadays. I'll keep developing both personal and commercial projects until I graduate from university.
