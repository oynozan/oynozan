## **HI THERE! I'M @oynozan**

I've just graduated from highschool and my past 3 year was a good opportunity to make myself a great Full-stack Web Developer.

To talk about my past experiences and career development, I can call myself as a Full-stack Web Developer with more than 3 years of experience. I've done tons of personal projects such as web sites, PHP/Python scripts, automation apps, desktop applications and coding challenges.

To detail my past job experiences, I can say that I've generally taken freelance jobs related to Frontend development and automation bot coding. Currently working on a social media startup as a Backend developer, also working on a Browser Game project as a Frontend developer with a team.

Also I have so many projects that are still in development process. They're generally related to game development and blockchain development.
